another way to have an "advanced shortcut" is with the *Mira* keyword

you can put *Mira* anywhere, and a language model of mira will fill in that part of the code. this works with comments so you can put instructions in comments... its kind of ridiculous

Audicle: || A Calming Piano Piece |> *Mira*

|| So mira will *do something* during runtime/compilation/JIT/live whatever to make this work. 
it really depends on how the mira is trained and again there is no guarentee that this will not fail and crash the program in an absurdly spectacular way- its really kind of amazing |>
