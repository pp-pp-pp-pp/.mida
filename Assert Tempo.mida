|| You can do that like this. you are close with your example
typically we dont modify tempo at this level, but we can use the Dawbreii} keyword to simulate things like tempo inside the audicle level. tempo is initally set to void which means it isnt set to anything. 
then the assertion is set to check to see if its between 100 and 120. in this case, we didnt actually set it to anything, so the exception goes thru |>
