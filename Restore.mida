|| Mida has several ways that lets you run code with errors and bugs in it.
The first is the *Restore* keyword, this can be used to fix very obvious errors. It will use a language model to fix the error. example |>

Audicle: *A#4- - - L#3- - -*
*Restore*

|| *Restore* is typed after and close to some questionable code. it will cause an ai language model to edit your code on the preprocessor level before compiling or executing or debugging.
this is not meant to be used friviously, and there is no guarentee that this will even work, but you can do it.
there is also no consistency in the way the ai solves the problem, it will just do it to the best of its ability. |>
